# **CIS 3500: Enhance a Chrome Extension (Lunch Lotto)**

## **Chrome Extension: Lunch Lotto**
- A Chrome extension that allows users to randomly select a lunch spot nearby
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jessie-sr/lunch-lotto)

## **Feature Added: History**

- Added a history feature to the extension, which allows users to view their previous lunch choices.
- Added buttons to clear the history and close the history popup.


## **Enhancements**
- Replaced Google Maps API with Overpass API for more developer-friendly results.
